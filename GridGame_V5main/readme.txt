Major Design Changes made in V5 - 06/27
- Fixed game UI in accordance with meeting notes
- Reverted the game to use WASD keyboard input, removing camera and sensor-based controls (temporary).
- Changed the grid size to 5x5. This can be easily changed down the line.
- Extended round length to 5 minutes.
- Added three player attributes—Service, Research, and Teaching—each represented by colored tiles (green, blue, purple) that award points when collected.
- Progress bars for these attributes now display on screen.
- I ensure that there is at least one of each tile type spawned per round.
